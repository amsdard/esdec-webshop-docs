# Using the app

Currently it is required for the user to have an account in the calculator. The integration without skipping the extra registration dialog is described in _Entering the calculator I_ section.

If you would like to automate registration/authentication, please make sure your webshop can work as an OAuth2 identity provider. Then refer to _Entering the calculator II_ section where the process is described in details.
In any other case, please contact us to setup a suitable solution.
